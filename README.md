Project Title : Android application to search near by places

Problem Statement/oppurtunity: I want to search for nearby places (ex: hospitals, schools, general clinics, etc.) in a certain radius of the user's current location. I have successfully managed to get the users current location, but don't know how to look for nearby places in the radius. I have managed to set up the html-attributions to get the nearby places.

Project description: A mobile app is built where the user can search for his nearby locations based on his requirement. Whenever the user gives input of business type like a hotel, petrol pumps, hospitals, etc. using Place API and as a response we obtain the co-ordinates that are marked on the Google map. App developed using the Google Maps API and Google Places API. The app consists on finding the nearest places around your location just by clicking on a button;moreover, this app also allows making searches with addresses and key words. This was made using Kotlin and Java programming languages on Android Studio. We can find the places like restaurants by entering our location by using latitude and longitude with the radius. Android app that search-finds near places on the map-Navigator.
